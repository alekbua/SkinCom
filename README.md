### Summary
The human skin hosts diverse microbiota, whose composition and diversity alterations have been linked to various skin diseases, such as acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, or seborrheic dermatitis. Here we present a robust, standardized model of the skin microbial community (SkinCom) to investigate complex in vitro and in vivo investigations of metabolite-microbe, microbe-microbe, and host-microbe interactions. Our methods lead to an accurate, reproducible, and diverse community formation of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Subsequent testing of SkinCom on the dorsal skin of mice allowed for the recovery from both the applied SkinCom and from dorsal skin, highlighting its practicality for in vivo studies and-omics analyses. Additionally, our results indicate that 65.6% of the responses to common cosmetic chemicals in vitro were recapitulated in the human trial.  Therefore, SkinCom represents a valuable, standardized tool for investigating microbe-microbe interactions and facilitates the experimental design of in vivo studies targeting host-microbe relationships.
